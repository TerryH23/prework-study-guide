# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

 This Prework Study Guide was created for bootcamp students as a foundation before class begins. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
 This project was built in order to get students into the mindset of a developer, while also including hands on experience.
 A problem that this study guide solved was having a visual end goal predetermined in order to help students get in the groove of what to expect while considering a User Story and Acceptance Criteria.
 This study guide has taught me some of the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has also shown me how you can have Git and Github communicate.
